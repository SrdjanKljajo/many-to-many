          First you need to create all the football teams you want to belong to
          your API, and then join the coaches. The API is constructed in such a
          way that one team cannot have two coaches, as well as that one coach
          cannot lead two clubs.
        </h6>
      </div>
      <p>
        When creating a team, it is necessary to input the name of the club, as
        well as the city and country in which it is located
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>teamName: ""</li>

        If you want to change the data related to teams or coaches, you can do
        so as follows:
      </h6>
      <p>
        When updating a team, it is necessary to input the new name of the club
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>teamName: ""</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text-left mb-5">

        PUT <code>http://18.185.73.229/api/v1/teams/:slug</code>

      <p>
        When updating a team coach, it is necessary to input the team slug and
        old team coach name.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>teamSlug: ""</li>
        <li>oldCoachSlug: ""</li>

        PUT <code>http://18.185.73.229/api/v1/coaches/:slug</code>
        <p class="mt-2">
          If the team is currently without a coach, assign it when creating a
          new coach. You have to keep in mind that a coach who has already been
          assigned to a team cannot be the coach of two clubs
        </p>
      </div>

        If you want to delete a football team or coach, you can do so in the
        following way:
